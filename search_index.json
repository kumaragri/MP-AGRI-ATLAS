The idea to create this Atlas was to explore the spatial dimension of the agriculture in Madhya Pradesh and to contribute to evidence based policy making. At several instance it is found that bureaucrats, academicians and students face difficulty in understanding spatial data to arrive at conclusion while looking at long and exhaustive tables for agricultural data. This difficulty can be overcome by use of picture; a picture is worth thousand words.

To prepare crop maps, data pertaining to area, production and yield were collected from 2011-12 to 2015-16. For creating the map of area, production and yield of each crop, quinquennial averages for each district were used. To categorize districts into high and low area as well as high and low productivity, concept of bulk line production is used. 80 percent of the total production of the crop in the State is termed as bulk line production. Quinquennial average of production is used to calculate bulk line production cut-off. Districts were arranged in descending order based on quinquennial average production. The median of area/yield for these districts quinquennial averages of area/yield was taken to be cut-off. To calculate quinquennial average yield for a district, the quinquennial average production was divided by quinquennial average area. Those districts which had area/yield greater than or equal to median area/yield qualified as high area/yield district and vice-versa being true. The following matrix was followed to categories districts into four segments for each crop considered in the Atlas. ## High Area Low Area ## High Yield &quot;High_Area-High_Yield&quot; &quot;Low_Area-High_Yield&quot; ## Low Yield &quot;High_Area-Low_Yield&quot; &quot;Low_Area-Low_Yield&quot; Data for district wise fertilizer sale for Madhya Pradesh was obtained from mfms portal (http://www.mfms.nic.in) for year 2017-18 on 13/11/2018. The data for district wise Forest cover was obtained from India State of Forest Report 2017 (Table 9.15.7, page 228-229). The R software for statistical computing was used in creating maps. Following R software packages were used in creating map: 1. tmap 2. tmaptools 3. sf 4. leaflet 5. rgdal 6. sp To create map, shapefiles were extracted from https://github.com/datameet/maps (original source at Community Created Maps of India, http://projects.datameet.org/maps/) on June 28, 2018 at time 12:46:52. Within the many layers of GIS, Districts/Census_2011/2011_Dist.shp was accessed to create Madhya Pradesh map with districts in it.
